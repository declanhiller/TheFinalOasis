-Cutscene-
Shows part of glacier falling down into the water with the seal on it
*cuts to black*
shows it drifing alone in the sun
shows seal jumping into the water
gives player controls right then and there

-First Biome-
coral reef
basically in the middle of it and you just have to explore basically the whole area... need to optimize this stuff hard
unguided story with no narration(party because no budget for VA or sound effects)
Should player be able to talk to wildlife or no??? ---  might add cool story in exchange for immersion
Not a lot of fish left super scarce... lots of white... representing climate change

-Second Biome-
River
Super linear with rivers splitting off but in the end it is not as free as the coral reef
Show a lot of trash in the river

-Third/Final biome-
Artic
More open but harder to get air
show the melted ice
Reunited with a dead mom dead by plastic pollution             
End of story is here


-Background-
Maybe have the background dominated by towering cities with saturation close to 100. This probably contributes a hell to the story
