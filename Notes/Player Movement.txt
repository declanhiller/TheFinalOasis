Player Movement
- W to move forward no moving backwards cuz that would not work. 
- Mouse is to point the character... only problem is that this might be wierd in third person but I guess a lot of battle royales do that
- Need extra keys to perform extra moves... like boost, and just useless tricks
- That should be about it... need to really make animation transitions smooth

Camera Relative to Player Movement
- Need to crank up camera smoothing to the next level...
- Case where if a person is going through a loop(think roller coaster) the camera will pause movement and only rotate to track the player.
This will be super hard to program because it will be hard to tell when a player is moving and meaning to do a loop. And it woukld also be hard
because raycasting depends on camera being right behnid player... Another way is that there is just a key and it would make it a lot easier.
- Behind player with z+ offset should work the best
- Need to figure out how to disconnect camera from player a lot to give better visuals while still keeping 3rd person shooteresque controls.
Could try doing cutscenes when the camera needs to move and make it super smooth like it's supposed to happen.
- Might need to change controls heavily.

New Player Movement Idea
- Use both WASD and Arrow Keys --- this could be brought over to controllers too
- Arrow Keys Control the Player Direction linked with the Camera. 
- Not a great idea for keyboard because having two inputs for direction in different ways is kinda shitty

Even Newer Player Movement idea
- Derivative of previous idea.
- Use WASD to contrller which direction the player will be going UP-LEFT-RIGHT-DOWN while using another button to swim forward...
- Camera still needs to be figured out a bit but should be a lot easier now.
- Need to figure out player controller a bit more about how the coding is gonna look but this should be the final iteration of the controller. 
- More free Camera Movement though this system will def encourage u to use a controller so it might be helpful to build around that
- if they are trying to point the character while idling it either
    -won't work
    -Only the player's head will look in that direction --- only problem is the fact that I have no clue if it is even possible to control a rig 
made in blender through unity. Needs more researh
    -might save time going first option but having the player's head point in the direction is a very nice touch i.e Hollow Knight(though there was actually a use for that tbh)

Camera movement relative to new player movement
- Can now just lock the camera behind the player and have the ability to unlock without affecting how the player will move.
- How should player be moving if we are giving side view then. probably still with whatever button is swim cuz WASD is not controlling player movment but rather the direction
- Can give a more cinematic angle during certain parts of the game --- a nice touch and almost a must have in adventure games i.e Abzu
